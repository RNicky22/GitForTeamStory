The cat gives the alien a treasure map, and the alien happily takes the map from the cat.

The alien then follows the map until he meets a detective.

The alien then asks if the detective found the treasure according to the map.

The detective told the alien a legend that this treasure was never returned by anyone who went looking for it.
They say there is a ghost guarding the treasure.

But the alien was not afraid so he continued along the path, eating all the ice cream along the way and met a wizard who was training himself. The alien asked the wizard to conjure up more ice cream for him.

The wizard casts a spell to make the aliens have ice cream for the rest of their journey. The alien walked in circles following the outline map the cat had given him, taking him around and returning to the original place.
Then he found the same cat again that had transformed into a dragon and was sitting guarding the treasure beneath the floor of the castle that had disappeared.

The alien was even more shocked than before because the dragon sitting guarding the pit glowed and stared at the alien's frozen ice cream.The alien lured the dragon out of the hole, gave him ice cream, and then went down to find the treasure the dragon was guarding.
